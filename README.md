# Roomate Finder
UVA CS 3240, Group A-22, Spring 2021

## Description

  Hello! Thank you for looking at our Django project. We made a site to faciliate the stressful proccess of finding an undergrad roomate at the University of Virginia.
Our site first asks some basic information about you, including some of the lifestyle habits, any compares you to other participants. If we think you would be a good 
match based on our algorithm, we tell both parties. Users have a chance to review every match, and if interested reach out to them!  

  Upon entering the site, users should first go to the "Roomate Questionnaire" tab and fill out the questionnaire there.  Once completed, you will be directed to your a profile page where you can review your information. If something is incorrect or you
change your mind, don't panic! Anything can be changed and your potential matches witll update to reflect this.  

Below is a short description of every page on the site

#### Home

The landing page for our site. Gives a breif discription of our site and why we built it. 

#### Roomate Questionnaire

This should be the first stop for all users. Here you can enter in information about yourself, or change previous input. Once submitted users are automatically
redirected to the "Your Profile" tab.

#### Your Profile

This is where users can review how they answered our algorithms questions. This is a great place to confirm everything was answered correctly, or reference a
a response if you forgot!

#### Your Results

The tab where things get exciting. You can see all the other students we think would make a good match as a roomate. After reviewing their profile, you can chose
to reach out and make a calendar with them to chat!


#### Your Calendar

This will display any and all upcoming meetings a user has scheduled with potential matches.

## Fun Festures
The aspects of our site we are particularly proud of:  

* Users are given a list of canidates we think would be good before making their final choice (as opposed to seeing every canidate possible, and having to comb throu
lots of unnecessary results.)
